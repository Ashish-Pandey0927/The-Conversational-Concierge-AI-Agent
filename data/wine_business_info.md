# Celestial Vines Estate - Napa Valley

## Our Story
Founded in 1985 by the Renaud family, Celestial Vines Estate is a testament to a passion for winemaking that has been passed down through three generations. Our philosophy is simple: great wine is made in the vineyard. We practice sustainable farming on our 100-acre estate to ensure the highest quality grapes that express the unique terroir of Napa Valley.

## Our Wines
We specialize in bold, expressive wines that reflect the character of our estate.

* **2021 Celestial Cabernet Sauvignon:** Our flagship wine. Notes of dark cherry, cassis, and a hint of vanilla. Aged 22 months in French oak. Price: $120/bottle.
* **2022 Starlight Chardonnay:** A vibrant and crisp Chardonnay with flavors of green apple, pear, and a touch of butterscotch. Fermented in stainless steel to preserve its bright acidity. Price: $65/bottle.
